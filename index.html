                    <p>Rosie is a small but super energetic dog. Whenever someone comes to the house she is very quick to run up and greet them. She loves to play fetch and will not leave you alone with her toys as she begs you to play with her.</p>

                    <p>Rosie is also a wonderful lap dog. If you sit on the couch she is quick to find a spot next to you. If you wear a blanket over your legs, you'll find her laying on your legs. She loves to cuddle and loves to be pet so she will always be right up on you.</p>

                    <p>Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His
                        paws are
                        white and they look like mittens.
                        Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get
                        injured.
                        Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes
                        crazy
                        and meows to go out.</p>

                <div class="desc">
                    <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside;
                        a bee
                        stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for
                        four
                        days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</p>

                    <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle.  He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him.  He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can 
                        pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
